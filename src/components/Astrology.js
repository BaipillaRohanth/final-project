            <li><h5>Yellow colour soil is good for business class.</h5></li>
            <li><h5>Plots/buildings sold by rich people for reasons other then misfortune & poverty is good. Sale by distressed, unfortunate people should be avoided.
 </h5></li>
            <li><h5>Rectangular plot with long north to south is better then long east to west.
 </h5></li>
            <li><h5>Wider front gate & narrow end is not good. Narrow front with wide back is good.
 </h5></li>
            <li><h5>A small sized plot between two bigger plots is not good.
 </h5></li>
            <li><h5>Reject any site with well towards North or East.
 </h5></li>
            <li><h5>If your plot is not rectangular see that at least South East and South West Corners have a 90 degrees angle.

            <li><h5>Never buy a plot which is cut on the North East corner.
 </h5></li>
            <li><h5>If North East corner of the plot is extended it is very good.
